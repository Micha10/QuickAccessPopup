- when maximal database size is exceeded, QAP removes oldest items until the maximal size minus 10% is respected
- when exiting QAP, it creates a backup of the database under the name QAP_Frequent.DB-BK, always overwriting the previous copy (this allows scheduled backup programs to copy the backup file even when the live database is locked by QAP)
 
"In the Works" menu
- at first launch of QAP, a new "In the Works" menu is added to Main menu including items "Frequent Folders", "Frequent Files", "Recent Folders", "Recent Files" and "Current Windows" (aka "Switch")

User Variables and Cloud Drives Placeholders
- user variables are custom placeholders that can be inserted in favorites properties and snippet content
- the button "User Variables" under the "More" tab of the "Options" dialog box opens the "User Variables" dialog box

New menu icons
- QAP now uses new color icons from the shared file JLicons.dll installed with QAP

Popup menu Hotkeys
------------------
New hotkey approach with two triggers:
 1) QAP hotkey (mouse and keyboard), available in all windows, opens the popup menu to choose the favoriteto launch; if the favorite is a folder and the target app supports it (Explorer, dialog box or other file managers), the window is changed (navigate) to this folder
 2) Alternative hotkey available in all windows, showing a menu of special features before showing the favorites menu (see "Alternative menu features" below)
Replace default keyboard FP hotkey Windows+A (#A) to Windows+W(#W) because #A is now a reserved shortcut in Windows 10

Actions
-------
Open favorite folders and special folders in current window (navigate) or in a new window (launch) if the target window supports navigation (Explorer, Dialog boxes, Directory Opus, TotalCommander, FPconnect and Console)

Open folder in a new window (even if the target window could navigate to this folder)
(more to be implemented)

Third party file managers
-------------------------
Support for Directory Opus
Support for Total Commander
Support for other file managers via FPconnect

Transition

/*

First, the whole story...

WORKING PARAMETER

If "/Working:" parameter is used from the command line (i.e. "c:\path\quickaccesspopup.exe /working:c:\another_path"),
this value have precedence. It allows to set a registry value to autostart QAP, for example:
Key:	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QuickAccessPopup
Value:	"C:\QAP_path\QuickAccessPopup.exe" "/Working:C:\any_path" (use double-quotes if space in found in path)

INSTALL MODE

Check in what mode QAP is running:
- if the file "_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt" is in A_ScriptDir, we are in Setup mode
- else we are in Portable mode.

IF PORTABLE

If we are in Portable mode, we keep the A_WorkingDir and return. It is equal to A_ScriptDir except if the user set the "Start In" folder in a shortcut.

IF SETUP

In the Start Menu Group "Quick Access Popup", setup program created a shortcut with "Start In" set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup"
(the Start Menu Group is created under the All Users profile unless the user installing the app does not have administrative privileges,
in which case it is created in the user's profile).

If A_WorkingDir equals A_ScriptDir and we are Setup mode, it means that QAP has been launched directly in the Program Files directory
instead of using the Start menu or Startup shortcuts. In this situation, we know that the working directory has not been set properly.
We change it to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".

In "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", setup program created or saved the file:
- "quickaccesspopup-setup.ini" (used to set initial QAP language to setup program language)

If, during setup, the user selected the "Import Folders Popup settings and favorites" option, the setup program will import the FP settings
and create the file "quickaccesspopup.ini" in "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup". An administrator could also create this file that will
be used as a template to be copied to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" when QAP is launched for the first time.

Normally, when the user starts QAP with the Start Group shortcut, A_WorkingDir is set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
If not, keep the A_WorkingDir set by the user and return.

If A_WorkingDir is "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", check if "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" exists. If not, create it.
If the files "quickaccesspopup-setup.ini", "quickaccesspopup.ini" and "QAPconnect.ini" do not exist in "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup", copy them
from "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup" if they exist.

Then, set A_WorkingDir to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" and return.

AFTER A_WORKINGDIR IS SET (PORTABLE OR SETUP)

- QAP copy the FileInstall temporary icon and localisation files.

- QAP checks if QAPconnect.ini exists in A_WorkingDir. If not, it creates a fresh one from the FileInstall file QAPconnect-default.ini.
If QAPconnect.ini already exists, it is not overwritten. Instead, a fresh copy of FileInstall file QAPconnect-default.ini is written to
A_WorkingDir where user can check if new file managers are supported.

- QAP checks if quickaccesspopup.ini exists in A_WorkingDir. If not, it creates a new one from an internal template.

Then, it continues initialization with quickaccesspopup.ini.

STARTUP SHORTCUT

If the "Run at startup" is enabled, a shortcut is created in the user's startup folder with "Start In" set to the current A_WorkingDir.
In Portable mode, A_WorkingDir is what the user decided. In Setup mode, A_WorkingDir is "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" (unless user changed it).

; Now, step-by-step...

; If "/Working:" parameter is used from the command line (i.e. "c:\path\quickaccesspopup.exe /working:c:\another_path"),
; this value have precedence. It allows to set a registry value to autostart QAP, for example:
; Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QuickAccessPopup
; Value: "C:\QAP_path\QuickAccessPopup.exe" "/Working:C:\any_path" (use double-quotes if space in found in path)

if StrLen(o_CommandLineParameters.AA["Working"])
	SetWorkingDir, % o_CommandLineParameters.AA["Working"]

; Check in what mode QAP is running:
; - if the file "_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt" is in A_ScriptDir, we are in Setup mode
; - else we are in Portable mode.

; If we are in Portable mode, we keep the A_WorkingDir and return. It is equal to A_ScriptDir except if the user set the "Start In" folder in a shortcut.
if !FileExist(A_ScriptDir . "\_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt")
{
	g_blnPortableMode := true ; set this variable for use later during init
	return
}
else
	g_blnPortableMode := false ; set this variable for use later during init

if StrLen(o_CommandLineParameters.AA["Working"]) ; we don't need to continue
	return

; Now we are in Setup mode

; If A_WorkingDir equals A_ScriptDir and we are Setup mode, it means that QAP has been launched directly in the Program Files directory
; instead of using the Start menu or Startup shortcuts. In this situation, we know that the working directory has not been set properly.
; We change it to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".

if (A_WorkingDir = A_ScriptDir) and FileExist(A_WorkingDir . "\_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt")
	SetWorkingDir, %A_AppDataCommon%\Quick Access Popup

; Normally, when the user starts QAP with the Start Group shortcut, A_WorkingDir is set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
; If not, QAP was possibily launched with a Startup shortcut that set the A_WorkingDir to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
; Keep the A_WorkingDir set by the shortcut and return.

if (A_WorkingDir <> A_AppDataCommon . "\Quick Access Popup")
	return

; If A_WorkingDir is "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", check if "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" exists. If not, create it.

if !FileExist(A_AppData . "\Quick Access Popup")
	FileCreateDir, %A_AppData%\Quick Access Popup

; If the files "quickaccesspopup-setup.ini", "quickaccesspopup.ini" and "QAPconnect.ini" do not exist in "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup",
; copy them from "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup" if they exist.
if !FileExist(A_AppData . "\Quick Access Popup\quickaccesspopup-setup.ini")

;------------------------------------------------------------
/*
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Special_characters#AutoHotkey
The escape character defaults to accent/backtick (`).

`, = , (literal comma). Note: Commas that appear within the last parameter of a command do not need to be escaped because the program knows to treat them literally. The same is true for all parameters of MsgBox because it has smart comma handling.
`% = % (literal percent)
`` = ` (literal accent; i.e. two consecutive escape characters result in a single literal character)
`; = ; (literal semicolon). Note: This is necessary only if a semicolon has a space or tab to its left. If it does not, it will be recognized correctly without being escaped.
`n = newline (linefeed/LF)
`r = carriage return (CR)
`b = backspace
`t = tab (the more typical horizontal variety)
`v = vertical tab -- corresponds to Ascii value 11. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+K.
`a = alert (bell) -- corresponds to Ascii value 7. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+G.
`f = formfeed -- corresponds to Ascii value 12. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+L.
Send = When the Send command or Hotstrings are used in their default (non-raw) mode, characters such as {}^!+# have special meaning. Therefore, to use them literally in these cases, enclose them in braces. For example: Send {^}{!}{{}
"" = Within an expression, two consecutive quotes enclosed inside a literal string resolve to a single literal quote. For example: Var := "The color ""red"" was found."

Process only:
`n = newline (linefeed/LF)
`t = tab (the more typical horizontal variety)

No need to process:
- | (pipe) used as separator in favorites lines in ini file are already replaced with the escape sequence ""

		; Instance variables are declared like normal assignments, but the this. prefix is omitted (only directly within the class body).
		; To access an instance variable (even within a method), always specify the target object; for example, this.InstanceVar
		
	; Static/Class Variables
		; Static/class variables belong to the class itself, but can be inherited by derived objects (including sub-classes).
		; They are declared like instance variables, but using the static keyword. Static declarations are evaluated only once, before the auto-execute section, in the order they appear in the script.
		; Each declaration stores a value in the class object. Any variable references in Expression are assumed to be global.
		; To assign to a class variable, always specify the class object; for example, ClassName.ClassVar := Value.
		; If an object x is derived from ClassName and x itself does not contain the key "ClassVar", x.ClassVar may also be used to dynamically retrieve the value of ClassName.ClassVar.

	; Lexikos: "The "property" doesn't have a value - a "property" is a set of methods which are called when you get or set the property. Not all properties will store a value - some will compute it,
	; such as from a different property. For instance, a Colour object might have R, G, B and RBG properties, but the first three would be derived from the last one.
