Hotstrings
- an hotstring is a small sequence of characters used as trigger to expand an abbreviation into the full text of a Snippet (auto-replace) or to launch any type of favorite

- due to large number of options combinations (taking into account case-sensitivity and other options), QAP does not validate that hotstring triggers are unique; in case of duplication, depending on various options, only one of the favorites having the same hotstring will be triggered
- in "Options", "Hotkeys" tab, a new button "Hotstrings default options" opens a dialog box where you can set default values for options of newly created hotstrings (these defaults do not impact existing hotstrings)

- remove support for old black and white buttons (already deprecated since v8.1.1)
 
Extended Search in favorites

- by default, with the "Extended Search" not checked, the Search tool only filters favorites based on their name
- if the "Extended Search" is checked, search also covers favorite type, shortcut text, hotstring trigger, location (file or folder path), snippet content, FTP login and advanced settings "Parameters" and "Start in" folder
 
Sort Live folders

Other new QAP Features

- File Shortcuts (.lnk): when adding a file shortcut with the "Add favorite" dialog box or using drag and drop, get the favorite default icon value and, for applications, the "Parameters" (command line arguments) and "Start In" working directory values from the file shortcut (this is already done that way when adding the shortcut using the Explorer context menu)
- Add favorite: reorder the types of favorites radio buttons in the "Select Type" dialog box when you add a favorite
- Windows Explorer: opening a folder that is already open in another Explorer window now brings the existing window to front (instead of creating a new window) except, of course, if you click inside an existing Explorer window, in which case it changes the folder inside this window
- Windows Explorer instances: before this release, opening a folder in a new window was creating a new Explorer instance for every new folder; now, the window for a new folder is created under the existing Explorer instance and only one Explorer instance is created by QAP (unless user open the Alternative menu "Open in new window" or if user adds an argument to the folder in "Advanced Settings" in which cases QAP must create new Explorer instances)
- Exclusions: add the capability to exclude menu mouse trigger (by default, Middle mouse button) by process name in addition to window title and class name (the process name is usually the name of the executable file of an application, for example: NOTEPAD.EXE) and add detection of process name when using the "Get window info" button below exclusion list in "Exclusion" tab of the "Options" window

Add an application favorite by selecting its path form a dropdown list of running apps
Edit window position for favorite types Folder, Special folders and Application, with a configurable delay when resizing or moving
Remember current window position when using "Add this folder"
Implementy FTP favorite type with login name, password and an option to encode login name and password in URL
Implement Group favorite with configurable delay when opening group (restoring groupe not done yet)

Options
-------
Convert all FP options
Add an exclusion list to disable QAP mouse popup menu hotkey in the selected type of windows
Option to display or not the favorite shortcuts reminders in popup menu (full name or abbreviated name)

Menus
-----
Build main menu
Build Current Folders menu
Build Recent Folders menu
Build Tray menu
Add default "My Special folders" menu at first QAP use
Add default "Essential QAP Features" menu at first QAP use
Convert startup tray tip
Test if current target window can navigate folder
Test if current window is on exclusion list before showing popup up
When Current Folders and Clipboard are empty, attach an "empty" sub menu
Add group indicator [[]] to popup menu with nb of items in groups

Popup menu Hotkeys
------------------
New hotkey approach with two triggers:
 1) QAP hotkey (mouse and keyboard), available in all windows, opens the popup menu to choose the favoriteto launch; if the favorite is a folder and the target app supports it (Explorer, dialog box or other file managers), the window is changed (navigate) to this folder
 2) Alternative hotkey available in all windows, showing a menu of special features before showing the favorites menu (see "Alternative menu features" below)
Replace default keyboard FP hotkey Windows+A (#A) to Windows+W(#W) because #A is now a reserved shortcut in Windows 10

Actions
-------
Open favorite folders and special folders in current window (navigate) or in a new window (launch) if the target window supports navigation (Explorer, Dialog boxes, Directory Opus, TotalCommander, FPconnect and Console)
Navigate favorite with Clover (using keyboard input)
Run application wit working directory and parameters
Launch documents or URL with "launch with" application and parameters
Support location placeholders in parameters
Implement QAP features "Add this folder" and "Copy Location"
Add this folder remembers window position (for use when open the folder in a new window)
Add this folder supports known special folders (50 known special folders)
Open FTP favorite with login name and password in Explorer, Directory Opus and Total Commander
Resize and move window to remembered position when opening folder in a new window (working with Explorer, DOpus, TC, not working with FPconnect yet)
Resize and move window to remembered position when launching application, document or URL (working with some apps, not all, not fully tested)

Alternative menu features
-------------------------
Open folder in a new window (even if the target window could navigate to this folder)
(more to be implemented)

Third party file managers
-------------------------
Support for Directory Opus
Support for Total Commander
Support for other file managers via FPconnect

Transition
----------
ImportFPsettings.ahk:
 - import favorites from Folders Popup and convert them to QAP format(replace all favorites)
 - import options settings from Folders Popup to QAP (overwrite existing options)

InnoSetup installer
-------------------
Prepare the QAP setup file, including ImportFPsettings.exe


Version: 6.0.1 alpha (2015-05-11)
* Replace "FoldersPopup" with "QuickAccessPopup"
* Update @Ahk2Exe-SetVersion with "6.0.1 alpha"
* Update strCurrentVersion with "6.0.1 alpha"
* Update @Ahk2Exe-SetDescription with "Most handy Windows launcher. Freeware!"
* Distinct variables strAppNameFile for "QuickAccessPopup" and strAppNameText for "Quick Access Popup"
* Update strCurrentBranch with "alpha"
* Adapt for alpha version without version checking for alpha branch
* Replace "FoldersPopup" with "QuickAccessPopup" in InitFileInstall, and language variable names
* Replace "strTempDir" with "g_strTempDir"

/*

First, the whole story...

WORKING PARAMETER

If "/Working:" parameter is used from the command line (i.e. "c:\path\quickaccesspopup.exe /working:c:\another_path"),
this value have precedence. It allows to set a registry value to autostart QAP, for example:
Key:	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QuickAccessPopup
Value:	"C:\QAP_path\QuickAccessPopup.exe" "/Working:C:\any_path" (use double-quotes if space in found in path)

INSTALL MODE

Check in what mode QAP is running:
- if the file "_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt" is in A_ScriptDir, we are in Setup mode
- else we are in Portable mode.

IF PORTABLE

If we are in Portable mode, we keep the A_WorkingDir and return. It is equal to A_ScriptDir except if the user set the "Start In" folder in a shortcut.

IF SETUP

In the Start Menu Group "Quick Access Popup", setup program created a shortcut with "Start In" set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup"
(the Start Menu Group is created under the All Users profile unless the user installing the app does not have administrative privileges,
in which case it is created in the user's profile).

If A_WorkingDir equals A_ScriptDir and we are Setup mode, it means that QAP has been launched directly in the Program Files directory
instead of using the Start menu or Startup shortcuts. In this situation, we know that the working directory has not been set properly.
We change it to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".

In "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", setup program created or saved the file:
- "quickaccesspopup-setup.ini" (used to set initial QAP language to setup program language)

If, during setup, the user selected the "Import Folders Popup settings and favorites" option, the setup program will import the FP settings
and create the file "quickaccesspopup.ini" in "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup". An administrator could also create this file that will
be used as a template to be copied to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" when QAP is launched for the first time.

Normally, when the user starts QAP with the Start Group shortcut, A_WorkingDir is set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
If not, keep the A_WorkingDir set by the user and return.

If A_WorkingDir is "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", check if "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" exists. If not, create it.
If the files "quickaccesspopup-setup.ini", "quickaccesspopup.ini" and "QAPconnect.ini" do not exist in "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup", copy them
from "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup" if they exist.

Then, set A_WorkingDir to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" and return.

AFTER A_WORKINGDIR IS SET (PORTABLE OR SETUP)

- QAP copy the FileInstall temporary icon and localisation files.

- QAP checks if QAPconnect.ini exists in A_WorkingDir. If not, it creates a fresh one from the FileInstall file QAPconnect-default.ini.
If QAPconnect.ini already exists, it is not overwritten. Instead, a fresh copy of FileInstall file QAPconnect-default.ini is written to
A_WorkingDir where user can check if new file managers are supported.

- QAP checks if quickaccesspopup.ini exists in A_WorkingDir. If not, it creates a new one from an internal template.

Then, it continues initialization with quickaccesspopup.ini.

STARTUP SHORTCUT

If the "Run at startup" is enabled, a shortcut is created in the user's startup folder with "Start In" set to the current A_WorkingDir.
In Portable mode, A_WorkingDir is what the user decided. In Setup mode, A_WorkingDir is "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" (unless user changed it).

*/

; Now, step-by-step...

; If "/Working:" parameter is used from the command line (i.e. "c:\path\quickaccesspopup.exe /working:c:\another_path"),
; this value have precedence. It allows to set a registry value to autostart QAP, for example:
; Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QuickAccessPopup
; Value: "C:\QAP_path\QuickAccessPopup.exe" "/Working:C:\any_path" (use double-quotes if space in found in path)

if StrLen(o_CommandLineParameters.I["Working"])
	SetWorkingDir, % o_CommandLineParameters.I["Working"]

; Check in what mode QAP is running:
; - if the file "_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt" is in A_ScriptDir, we are in Setup mode
; - else we are in Portable mode.

; If we are in Portable mode, we keep the A_WorkingDir and return. It is equal to A_ScriptDir except if the user set the "Start In" folder in a shortcut.
if !FileExist(A_ScriptDir . "\_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt")
{
	g_blnPortableMode := true ; set this variable for use later during init
	return
}
else
	g_blnPortableMode := false ; set this variable for use later during init

if StrLen(o_CommandLineParameters.I["Working"]) ; we don't need to continue
	return

; Now we are in Setup mode

; If A_WorkingDir equals A_ScriptDir and we are Setup mode, it means that QAP has been launched directly in the Program Files directory
; instead of using the Start menu or Startup shortcuts. In this situation, we know that the working directory has not been set properly.
; We change it to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".

if (A_WorkingDir = A_ScriptDir) and FileExist(A_WorkingDir . "\_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt")
	SetWorkingDir, %A_AppDataCommon%\Quick Access Popup

; Normally, when the user starts QAP with the Start Group shortcut, A_WorkingDir is set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
; If not, QAP was possibily launched with a Startup shortcut that set the A_WorkingDir to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
; Keep the A_WorkingDir set by the shortcut and return.

if (A_WorkingDir <> A_AppDataCommon . "\Quick Access Popup")
	return

; If A_WorkingDir is "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", check if "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" exists. If not, create it.

if !FileExist(A_AppData . "\Quick Access Popup")

;------------------------------------------------------------
/*
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Special_characters#AutoHotkey
The escape character defaults to accent/backtick (`).

`, = , (literal comma). Note: Commas that appear within the last parameter of a command do not need to be escaped because the program knows to treat them literally. The same is true for all parameters of MsgBox because it has smart comma handling.
`% = % (literal percent)
`` = ` (literal accent; i.e. two consecutive escape characters result in a single literal character)
`; = ; (literal semicolon). Note: This is necessary only if a semicolon has a space or tab to its left. If it does not, it will be recognized correctly without being escaped.
`n = newline (linefeed/LF)
`r = carriage return (CR)
`b = backspace
`t = tab (the more typical horizontal variety)
`v = vertical tab -- corresponds to Ascii value 11. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+K.
`a = alert (bell) -- corresponds to Ascii value 7. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+G.
`f = formfeed -- corresponds to Ascii value 12. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+L.
Send = When the Send command or Hotstrings are used in their default (non-raw) mode, characters such as {}^!+# have special meaning. Therefore, to use them literally in these cases, enclose them in braces. For example: Send {^}{!}{{}
"" = Within an expression, two consecutive quotes enclosed inside a literal string resolve to a single literal quote. For example: Var := "The color ""red"" was found."

Process only:
`n = newline (linefeed/LF)
`t = tab (the more typical horizontal variety)

No need to process:
- | (pipe) used as separator in favorites lines in ini file are already replaced with the escape sequence ""
