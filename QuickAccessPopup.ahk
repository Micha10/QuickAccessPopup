HISTORY

- v8.5.3 fixes a comment typo in v8.5.2 preventing the app to load
- reverting change from v8.5.1 causing issues for users having special characters in their favorites paths : at QAP startup, STOPS converting QuickAccessPopup.ini to Unicode encoding if it is is ANSI (until more tests are done)
- for new installations, this change is maintained: create new settings file QuickAccessPopup.ini with Unicode encoding

Version: 8.5.1 (2017-09-07)

- fix bug expand placeholder {CUR_LOC} in application favorite's working directory before checking if directory exists
- fix bug display "Reset default hotkey" in "Select hotkey" dialog box when there is no default

Version: 8.5 (2017-09-04)
  
Menu key
- you can now use the Menu key (also called Context menu key or Application key) to pop up the QAP menu or launch any favorite

- new QAP feature "Reopen Current Folder in dialog box" allowing to reopen in a dialog box the current location in Windows Explorer
- the current location is the folder currently displayed in the active (or in the last active) Windows Explorer window
- current location is also detected in Directory Opus or Total Commander if one of these file magagers is enabled
  
Hotkeys
- set QAP feature default hotkeys for "Reopen Current Folder" to Shift+Ctrl+C  (of course, you can change it at any time)

SetQAPWorkingDirectory:
;-----------------------------------------------------------

/*

First, the whole story...

Check in what mode QAP is running:
- if the file "_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt" is in A_ScriptDir, we are in Setup mode
- else we are in Portable mode.

IF PORTABLE

If we are in Portable mode, we keep the A_WorkingDir and return. It is equal to A_ScriptDir except if the user set the "Start In" folder in a shortcut.

IF SETUP

In the Start Menu Group "Quick Access Popup", setup program created a shortcut with "Start In" set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup"
(the Start Menu Group is created under the All Users profile unless the user installing the app does not have administrative privileges,
in which case it is created in the user's profile).

If A_WorkingDir equals A_ScriptDir and we are Setup mode, it means that QAP has been launched directly in the Program Files directory
instead of using the Start menu or Startup shortcuts. In this situation, we know that the working directory has not been set properly.
We change it to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".

In "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", setup program created or saved the file:
- "quickaccesspopup-setup.ini" (used to set initial QAP language to setup program language)

If, during setup, the user selected the "Import Folders Popup settings and favorites" option, the setup program will import the FP settings
and create the file "quickaccesspopup.ini" in "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup". An administrator could also create this file that will
be used as a template to be copied to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" when QAP is launched for the first time.

Normally, when the user starts QAP with the Start Group shortcut, A_WorkingDir is set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
If not, keep the A_WorkingDir set by the user and return.

If A_WorkingDir is "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", check if "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" exists. If not, create it.
If the files "quickaccesspopup-setup.ini", "quickaccesspopup.ini" and "QAPconnect.ini" do not exist in "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup", copy them
from "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup" if they exist.

Then, set A_WorkingDir to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" and return.

AFTER A_WORKINGDIR IS SET (PORTABLE OR SETUP)

- QAP copy the FileInstall temporary icon and localisation files.

- QAP checks if QAPconnect.ini exists in A_WorkingDir. If not, it creates a fresh one from the FileInstall file QAPconnect-default.ini.
If QAPconnect.ini already exists, it is not overwritten. Instead, a fresh copy of FileInstall file QAPconnect-default.ini is written to
A_WorkingDir where user can check if new file managers are supported.

- QAP checks if quickaccesspopup.ini exists in A_WorkingDir. If not, it creates a new one from an internal template.

Then, it continues initialization with quickaccesspopup.ini.

STARTUP SHORTCUT

If the "Run at startup" is enabled, a shortcut is created in the user's startup folder with "Start In" set to the current A_WorkingDir.
In Portable mode, A_WorkingDir is what the user decided. In Setup mode, A_WorkingDir is "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" (unless user changed it).

*/

; Now, step-by-step...

; Check in what mode QAP is running:
; - if the file "_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt" is in A_ScriptDir, we are in Setup mode
; - else we are in Portable mode.

; If we are in Portable mode, we keep the A_WorkingDir and return. It is equal to A_ScriptDir except if the user set the "Start In" folder in a shortcut.
if !FileExist(A_ScriptDir . "\_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt")
{
	g_blnPortableMode := true ; set this variable for use later during init
	return
}
else
	g_blnPortableMode := false ; set this variable for use later during init

; Now we are in Setup mode

; If A_WorkingDir equals A_ScriptDir and we are Setup mode, it means that QAP has been launched directly in the Program Files directory
; instead of using the Start menu or Startup shortcuts. In this situation, we know that the working directory has not been set properly.
; We change it to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".

if (A_WorkingDir = A_ScriptDir) and FileExist(A_WorkingDir . "\_do_not_remove_or_rename.txt")
	SetWorkingDir, %A_AppDataCommon%\Quick Access Popup

; Normally, when the user starts QAP with the Start Group shortcut, A_WorkingDir is set to "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
; If not, QAP was possibily launched with a Startup shortcut that set the A_WorkingDir to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup".
; Keep the A_WorkingDir set by the shortcut and return.

if (A_WorkingDir <> A_AppDataCommon . "\Quick Access Popup")
	return

; If A_WorkingDir is "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup", check if "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" exists. If not, create it.

if !FileExist(A_AppData . "\Quick Access Popup")
	FileCreateDir, %A_AppData%\Quick Access Popup

; If the files "quickaccesspopup-setup.ini", "quickaccesspopup.ini" and "QAPconnect.ini" do not exist in "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup",
; copy them from "{commonappdata}\Quick Access Popup" if they exist.
if !FileExist(A_AppData . "\Quick Access Popup\quickaccesspopup-setup.ini")
	FileCopy, %A_AppDataCommon%\Quick Access Popup\quickaccesspopup-setup.ini, %A_AppData%\Quick Access Popup
if !FileExist(A_AppData . "\Quick Access Popup\quickaccesspopup.ini")
	FileCopy, %A_AppDataCommon%\Quick Access Popup\quickaccesspopup.ini, %A_AppData%\Quick Access Popup
if !FileExist(A_AppData . "\Quick Access Popup\QAPconnect.ini")
	FileCopy, %A_AppDataCommon%\Quick Access Popup\QAPconnect.ini, %A_AppData%\Quick Access Popup

; Then, set A_WorkingDir to "{userappdata}\Quick Access Popup" and return.

/*
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Special_characters#AutoHotkey
The escape character defaults to accent/backtick (`).

`, = , (literal comma). Note: Commas that appear within the last parameter of a command do not need to be escaped because the program knows to treat them literally. The same is true for all parameters of MsgBox because it has smart comma handling.
`% = % (literal percent)
`` = ` (literal accent; i.e. two consecutive escape characters result in a single literal character)
`; = ; (literal semicolon). Note: This is necessary only if a semicolon has a space or tab to its left. If it does not, it will be recognized correctly without being escaped.
`n = newline (linefeed/LF)
`r = carriage return (CR)
`b = backspace
`t = tab (the more typical horizontal variety)
`v = vertical tab -- corresponds to Ascii value 11. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+K.
`a = alert (bell) -- corresponds to Ascii value 7. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+G.
`f = formfeed -- corresponds to Ascii value 12. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing Control+L.
Send = When the Send command or Hotstrings are used in their default (non-raw) mode, characters such as {}^!+# have special meaning. Therefore, to use them literally in these cases, enclose them in braces. For example: Send {^}{!}{{}
"" = Within an expression, two consecutive quotes enclosed inside a literal string resolve to a single literal quote. For example: Var := "The color ""red"" was found."

Process only:
`n = newline (linefeed/LF)
`t = tab (the more typical horizontal variety)

No need to process:
- | (pipe) used as separator in favorites lines in ini file are already replaced with the escape sequence ""
